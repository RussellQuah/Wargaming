# Wargaming customer segmentation

## Problem statement
Build a prototype customer segmentation algorithm on customer data

## Solution
Used unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm to identify 5 different customer segments

## Segments identified:
- Segment 0: Casual players with lowest attributes
- Segment 1: Main demographic of WoT players
- Segment 2: Competitive players with highest skill cap
- Segment 3: Main demographic of WoT players
- Segment 4: Players who are willing to spend

## Next steps
# Next steps
- Wargaming to actively reduce the churn rate of segment 0 (casual players). More data is needed to identify why these group of players are not returning to play.

- Maintain current levels of support for segments 2 and 4 (competitive and those willing to spend).

- Try to find out why segment 1 is spending more in game than segment 3 to try and bridge the gap.

- Could further test the segments by running additional clustering models like K-NN to support decision to group into 5 segments
